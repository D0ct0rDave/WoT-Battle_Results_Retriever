## Description

The BRR mod makes sure that battle files are created and saved from the World of Tanks game client after a game is done.
Without the BRR mod the WoT game client only produce this file if the after battle statistics are shown in game (in hangar).

The compiled version of the file mod (pyc) is included in the WotNumbers application and automatically saved to the WoT game installation folder if missing.

For manually installing the mod copy the file to the WoT game folder: ~\res_mods\X.X.X.X\scripts\client\gui\mods
